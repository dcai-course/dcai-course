General resources related to machine learning and data-centric AI that we
recommend. For additional resources on the topics covered in lectures,
see the references in individual lecture notes.

# Open-Source Software Tools

- [cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) - automatically detect problems in a dataset to facilitate ML with messy, real-world data
- [refinery](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery) - assess and maintain natural language data
- [great expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations) - validate, document, and profile data for quality testing
- [ydata-profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) - generate summary reports of tabular datasets stored as pandas DataFrame
- [albumentations](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations) - data augmentation for computer vision
- [label-studio](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio) - interfaces to label and annotate data for many ML tasks
